# Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning

This project follows material outlined in [this tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial), based on a Stanford course with the same title.

`train.py` implements a 3-layer autoencoder, which is a fully connected unsupervised neural network.
The data is randomly generated rectangles, source in `generate_data.py`.
